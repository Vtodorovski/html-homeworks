    </h3>
    <p>
        An intriguing and enthralling non-English TV series that has only seemed to get better with time is Money Heist.
        The show's fifth installment arrived in late 2021 and obliterated records for Netflix's viewership, amassing
        close to 800 million hours watched in its first month.The show's dramatization of the Spanish economy and its
        fresh take on the typical "heist" trope provides a phenomenal series worth watching more than once.

        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        In March 2022, the long-awaited second season of Bridgerton finally arrived. One of the only Netflix shows to
        receive a viewership of more than 600 million hours came thanks to its twists and turns. The British regal drama
        continued its survey of high society and sibling rivalry with a flair that caught the attention of millions.
        It did so well that it was renewed for a third and fourth season, as reported by Deadline, which could very well
        break its own viewership records in the future.

        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        One of the defining Netflix original series is Stranger Things, which has made its return for its fourth out of
        five seasons. But, in 2019, Stranger Things 3 captured the Hawkins kids and the Upside Down in the summer of the
        '80s.
        The third season added even more confusion, and Stranger Things 4 has answered many burning questions since
        then. The appeal of Stranger Things remains, and the show has the potential to out-perform every Netflix top 10
        in its first 28 days.

            <b>4. Lucifer (Season 5 - 569 Million Hours)</b>
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        One show that has managed to continually remain popular is Lucifer. Many shows see a decline in quality the
        longer they go on which can lead to viewers losing interest, but Lucifer actually garnered its most views with
        its fifth out of six seasons, clocking 569 million hours watched.
        As if setting records for Netflix's numbers wasn't enough, it even beat out Squid Game in 2021 as the
        most-watched show of the year. It may not be as fresh as Netflix break-outs, but it has proven it's here to
        stay.

            <b>5. All of us are dead (Season 1 - 560 Million Hours)</b>
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        One of the few non-English TV series to reach such sought-after numbers is All of Us Are Dead. The show is set
        in a South Korean high school, where a zombie apocalypse ensues. The show is dramatic, tense, and often heroic.
